# Machine Learning Hands-On (ML-HOL)

A hands-on learning material covering machine learning and deep learning from basics to applications. You can learn both theory and implementation simultaneously using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

This repository provides a series of Jupyter Notebooks covering from machine learning fundamentals to practical deep learning topics. Each notebook includes theoretical explanations and Python implementations, designed for interactive learning.

## Learning Content

### 1. Machine Learning Basics (01_machine_learning_basics.ipynb)
- Overview of machine learning
- Basic structure of neural networks
- Parameter learning mechanisms
- Classification problems and loss functions
- Backpropagation
- Learning rate and optimization methods
- Hands-on: Implementation of simple neural networks

### 2. Deep Neural Networks (02_deep_neural_networks_tutorial.ipynb)
- Basic concepts of deep learning
- Building DNNs using Keras
- Regularization techniques (L1/L2 regularization, dropout)
- Advanced optimization algorithms
- Model evaluation and visualization

### 3. Convolutional Neural Networks (03_cnn_tutorial.ipynb)
- Basic structure of CNNs
- Convolutional and pooling layers
- Image classification tasks
- Data augmentation
- Transfer learning

### 4. Recurrent Neural Networks (04_rnn_basics.ipynb)
- Basic concepts of RNNs
- Sequential data processing
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Text generation and time series prediction

## Target Audience

- Those with basic programming knowledge
- Those who want to systematically learn machine learning and deep learning
- Those who want to learn both theory and implementation
- Those interested in data science and AI fields

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python syntax
- Basic usage of NumPy and Pandas
- Basic mathematics knowledge at university level (calculus and linear algebra) is preferred

## Environment Setup

Please refer to [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for environment setup instructions.

## How to Study

1. We recommend executing the notebooks in order
2. Run code cells and check the results
3. Read the explanations to understand the theory and learn implementation methods
4. Try the practice problems at the end of each notebook
5. Experiment by changing parameters or trying with your own data
